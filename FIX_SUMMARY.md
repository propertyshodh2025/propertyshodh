# Fix Summary: Admin Dashboard CRM Lead Display Issue

## Problem
When leads are assigned to admins from the superadmin dashboard, those leads were not appearing in the assigned admin's CRM tab "New" column.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing RPC Functions**: The SuperAdminCRMKanban was calling `get_all_leads_for_superadmin()` which didn't exist
2. **Session Token Issue**: The adminSupabase client wasn't properly sending session tokens in headers, causing RLS to block access
3. **Direct Database Queries**: AdminCRMKanban was using direct `from('leads').select('*')` which relied on broken RLS

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed adminSupabase Client (`src/lib/adminSupabase.ts`)
- **Before**: Used static headers with `'x-admin-bypass': 'true'` which was insecure and broken
- **After**: Implemented dynamic session token headers using `'x-admin-session'` with proper session management
- Created `getAdminSupabase()` function that includes current session token in headers
- Used Proxy pattern for backward compatibility

### 2. Created Missing RPC Functions (`supabase/migrations/20250914084100_fix_leads_rpc_functions.sql`)
- **`get_all_leads_for_superadmin()`**: Allows superadmins to see all leads
- **`get_admin_assigned_leads()`**: Returns leads assigned to current admin (or all leads for superadmins)
- **Updated `get_admin_credentials()`**: Fixed to work with new session system

### 3. Updated AdminCRMKanban (`src/components/admin/AdminCRMKanban.tsx`)
- **Before**: `adminSupabase.from('leads').select('*')` - relied on broken RLS
- **After**: `adminSupabase.rpc('get_admin_assigned_leads')` - uses proper session-aware RPC

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have valid admin credentials in your database
2. Apply the SQL migration to your Supabase database (manually run the SQL in `supabase/migrations/20250914084100_fix_leads_rpc_functions.sql`)

### Testing Steps
1. **Start the application**: It's already running on http://localhost:8082/
2. **Login as SuperAdmin**:
   - Go to admin login
   - Login with superadmin credentials
   - Navigate to CRM tab
   - Create some leads and assign them to regular admins

3. **Login as Regular Admin**:
   - Logout and login as a regular admin
   - Navigate to CRM tab
   - You should now see leads assigned to you in the "New" column

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Superadmin can see all leads and assign them to admins
- ✅ Regular admins can see only leads assigned to them
- ✅ Leads assigned from superadmin dashboard appear in admin's CRM "New" column
- ✅ Session authentication works properly with RLS

## Key Technical Details
- Session tokens are now properly passed in `x-admin-session` header
- RLS policies use `get_admin_from_session()` to validate access
- RPC functions provide secure, session-aware data access
- Backward compatibility maintained through Proxy pattern

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Apply the migration to your Supabase database
2. Test the functionality as described above
3. Consider implementing proper session token refresh mechanism for long-running sessions
